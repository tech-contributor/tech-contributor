Welcome to visit my readme file!
I've been working as a software engineer for over 10 years on several projects with GoLang, Python and web programming frameworks running on node.js runtime platform.
Troubleshooting and resolving issues are on my list of favorite things to do.
To get more knowledgement of software engineering, now I'm eager to collaborate with other senior developers and contribute to open source projects.

Thanks for reading.
